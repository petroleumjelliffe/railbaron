/**
 * The movement rules, stored as data. One game states one rule, and every one
 * of them is awkward to reach by playing normally — which is why they are
 * written down rather than found.
 *
 * Every node id here was read off the built graph, never assumed. The
 * neighbourhoods each game leans on:
 *
 *   c13 Minneapolis -> d417[GN,NP] d131[C&NW] d127[C&NW] d222[CMStP&P]
 *                      d352[CMStP&P] d66[CRI&P] c95 St. Paul[C&NW,CMStP&P,NP,GN]
 *   c95 St. Paul    -> c13 only — a spur
 *   c40 San Francisco -> c41 Oakland[AT&SF,SP] only — a spur
 *   c41 Oakland     -> d271[AT&SF] d54[SP] d86[SP] c40[AT&SF,SP]
 *   c4  Fargo       -> d324[GN] d372[GN] d201[NP] d192[NP]
 *   d417            -> d372[GN] c13[GN,NP] d201[NP]
 *   d372            -> c4[GN] d417[GN]
 *   d131            -> d123[C&NW] c13[C&NW] d15[C&NW]
 *   c12 Billings    -> d397[NP] d147[NP] d64[CB&Q]
 *   d397            -> d176[NP,CMStP&P] c12[NP] d146[CMStP&P]
 *   j2 (junction)   -> d252[GN] d170[NP] d176[NP]
 *   c65 Los Angeles -> d402[AT&SF,SP] d452[AT&SF] d423[SP]
 *   d452            -> c65[AT&SF] c75 San Diego[AT&SF]
 *
 * `bonus-die-freight` also walks the long GN run west of Minneapolis — its
 * first turn ends on d372, and the double-six turn goes on c4 d324 d156 d353
 * d304 d250 d221 d121 d129 d143 d284 d161, then d152 d163 d394 on the bonus.
 * A Freight's double six costs twelve dots to walk, and the rule that game
 * states is about not arriving inside them. Read off the built graph the same
 * way, one dot at a time.
 *
 * Every fixture starts on a city, so `src/state/replay.golden.test.ts` can
 * build a real log for each one and hold the runner and `replay` together.
 *
 * **A golden game invalidated by a later rule is deleted, not patched.** These
 * are the rules as understood when they were written down; a later phase — the
 * money spec first — may make one of them wrong rather than incomplete. The
 * response is to remove the game and say in the commit message which rule
 * retired it. Editing a fixture's steps until it passes again turns the record
 * of what the game does into a record of what the code does, which is exactly
 * what these exist not to be.
 *
 * Not every rule in the spec's table can live here. The runner plays one
 * baron: it has no seats, no turn order and no log, so "two barons rolling the
 * same home city" — the table's ninth row — cannot be written as a golden
 * game at all. It is pinned instead by `engine/roll.test.ts` ("never lands on
 * a home city another baron already holds") and by
 * `src/state/useGame.test.tsx` ("refuses a home city another baron already
 * holds"), which have the seats this file does not.
 *
 * Several games still script a third, unused face for a two-dice roll, and
 * the reason has changed with the staging rather than gone away. `rollTurn`
 * now takes exactly two draws whatever the train — the Bonus Roll is a
 * separate roll, and the `bonusRoll` intent carries its own face. So a
 * correct engine never reaches the spare. An engine that regressed to rolling
 * the bonus up front would, and `runner.ts`'s `scripted()` throws on an empty
 * queue rather than returning a rejection: that throw would fail the game
 * before its own assertion ever ran, pinning nothing. The spare gives the
 * regressed engine somewhere to draw from, so the game runs on to its real
 * `bonus: null` assertion and fails there, saying what actually broke.
