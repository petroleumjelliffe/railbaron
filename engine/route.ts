 * but a thing a tap passes through: the search walks on through it and offers
 * the dots on the far side instead. At a genuine fork that means each branch's
 * first real dot is offered separately, which is exactly the choice the
 * printed board asks the player to make.
 *
 * The walk extends the draft at every hop rather than reading adjacency, so
 * each intermediate step is judged by the real rules — the section already
 * spent, the company the run is committed to since the last dot, the
 * destination it must not be stranded from.
 *
 * `seen` is per-branch and guards against a graph whose bend points adjoin:
 * two of those would hand the pawn back and forth, since their shared edge
 * may carry several railroads and a re-crossing would be perfectly legal. No
 * junction in the shipped network touches another — all twelve have only dot
 * and city neighbours, so no chain here is longer than two steps — which
 * makes the guard defensive rather than load-bearing. It costs one set.
