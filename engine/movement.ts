 * of twin cities count as one dot for the pair" — so crossing between the two
 * members of a pair is free, having already been paid for on the way in.

 * times, each time on a different line, which is exactly what the book allows:
 * the pawn "may move between the same two dots again, as long as it uses a
 * different rail line."
 *
 * This counts crossings rather than naming which company each one rode. Where
 * that is loose: it does not check that a re-crossing rode a *different*
 * company from the first, only that a different one was available. Pairing
 * each crossing with a company would need the player to declare one at every
 * step, and the case where it matters — re-crossing shared trackage on the
 * same line while a junction constrains which line that is — is rare enough
 * that the interrogation costs more than the looseness does.

 * So: is the destination reachable at all over sections not yet spent? A

 * movement is left — which is why this can run on every tap and why a roll
 * totalling 18 is no harder than one totalling 12.

 * make this a search over (node, company) pairs to rule out routes a player
 * could not have taken anyway; the book's own phrasing is about sections, and
 * the looser answer only ever permits a tap that a later tap would refuse.
