# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A **companion app** for the Avalon Hill board game *Rail Baron*, not an implementation of
it. Players use the physical board; the app rolls each baron's next destination — region,
then city — looks up the payout for the journey, and since Phase 4 walks the pawn: strict
turn order, the movement dice, and a route tapped out dot by dot on the map. What is still
not modelled is the money — no railroad ownership, no purchases, no user fees, no win
condition. It does keep a running total of what each baron has been paid (`earned` in
[`src/state/game.ts`](src/state/game.ts)), which is a sum of rolled payouts for naming the
leader — not the game's cash, which players still track themselves.

The repo holds the React port. The original 2013 jQuery app was deleted once the port
was complete and tested — it remains in git history, but there is only one Rail Baron in
this repo now. [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) has the phases and the reasoning; Phases 1 and 2
(the roller, the pass-and-play front door) are done, and so is Phase 4's first half —
turns and movement, with the map as the play surface and the movement rules stored as
data under [`engine/golden/`](engine/golden/). The money spec (ownership, fees, cash, the
win condition) and Phase 3 (online multiplayer) are ahead.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
git submodule update --init --recursive  # vendor/lobby — the server imports it at runtime

npm run dev        # Vite dev server, http://localhost:7931/railbaron/
npm run dev:server  # game server (online mode), port 4001
npm run dev:all     # both at once; online mode needs both
npm test            # vitest run — every project, once
npm run test:watch  # vitest, watch mode
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm run build        # vite build, production bundle to dist/
npm run build:server # a guard, not a build: fails if vendor/lobby is empty
npm run preview      # serve the production build locally
npm run serve        # build, then one process hosting client + sockets on 4001

npx vitest run engine/payouts.test.ts        # one test file
npx vitest run --project node                # one project (node | app)
npx vitest run src/board/screens/play.test.ts -t "shows a zero-paying"  # one test by name
# scope -t to a file: a bare name filter marks every non-matching file as failed

npm run graph:validate  # structural checks on data/rail-baron-graph.json
npm run network:build   # rebuild engine/network.json from the traced graph
npm run outline:build   # rebuild the coastline outline
```

Ports come from the cross-game registry — canonical in the sibling
[`game-host`](../game-host) repo's `PORTS.md`, alongside the Caddy reverse proxy and
game-night menu that consume it: each game hosted from this machine gets a server slot
(4001+) and a dev-client slot (7931+); Rail Baron is 4001/7931, and the numbers live in
exactly three places — that registry, the server's boot default, and `vite.config.ts`.
The client is origin-relative (`src/config.ts`): pages, assets and sockets ride the
page's origin, sockets mounted at `/railbaron/socket.io`, and health answers at both
`/health` and `/railbaron/health`. In dev, Vite's proxy carries the one socket path to
the server on 4001; hosted (`npm run serve`, or behind game-host's front door), the
server answers it itself. Vite pins its port with `strictPort` and listens on the LAN
(`host: true`), so friends on the wifi reach it directly or through the proxy. (The
LAN-hosting spec,
[docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-16-lan-hosting-design.md](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-16-lan-hosting-design.md),
is design history: its client-side `hostname:port` derivation was retired for
origin-relative sockets — see the game-host repo's
`specs/2026-08-17-origin-relative-clients.md`.) A build that sets `VITE_SERVER_URL`
wins outright and keeps socket.io's default path — that server owns its whole origin.
`SOCKET_PATH` in the environment moves the socket mount at boot (nothing sets it
today; it exists for a deploy that owns its whole origin). To move the server port for
a one-off, put `VITE_SERVER_PORT=<port>` in `.env.local` (gitignored) and move
`vite.config.ts`'s proxy target with it; `PORT` still overrides.

Tests run as two Vitest projects (`vite.config.ts`). **`node`** takes everything that runs
inside the server process in production — `engine/`, `session/`, `server/`, the pure half
of `src/state/`, and the lobby's `protocol/` and `server/` halves. **`app`** takes the rest
of `src/` and the lobby's `client/`, under `jsdom` with `src/test/setup.ts` loaded.

The split of `src/state` is one honest line: `storage.test.ts` is the file whose subject
*is* `localStorage`, so it stays in jsdom, and the extglob `src/state/!(storage).test.ts`
names it once for both projects to read. Do not add a root-level `setupFiles` — vitest 4
merges those into every project, which would bridge jsdom's Storage into the node project
and silently disarm `session/nodeEnvironment.test.ts`, the test that guards the boundary.
`engine/smoke.test.ts` asserts `window` is `undefined` in the engine project, so a React
or DOM dependency creeping into `engine/` fails a test rather than surviving unnoticed.
(It does not also assert `localStorage` is `undefined`: Node 26 defines
`globalThis.localStorage` as a getter that returns `undefined` without
`--localstorage-file`, in both the plain-node project and a bare jsdom project alike —
jsdom's real `Storage` only reaches `globalThis` via the bridge described below, which
this project doesn't load — so that half would pass in both environments and guard
nothing.)

## The game data, and its known bugs

Everything the roller needs is under [`engine/`](engine/) — no React, no DOM. The 2013
source it was transcribed from, `js/railbaronv2.js`, no longer exists in the working tree
but is still in git history (`git log --all --full-history -- js/railbaronv2.js`).

- **[`engine/rollTable.ts`](engine/rollTable.ts)'s `CODES`** — a 22-row lookup indexed by
  `rollRow()`, which is one d6 + one d6 + a d2×11. Column 0 gives the region; columns 1–7
  give the city within each region.
- **[`engine/regions.ts`](engine/regions.ts)'s `REGIONS`** — 7 entries.
- **[`engine/cities.ts`](engine/cities.ts)'s `CITIES`** — 7 region groups, 67 cities, each
  with a globally unique `id` 0–66.
- **[`engine/payouts.ts`](engine/payouts.ts)'s `PAYOUT_TABLE`** — a triangular matrix
  indexed `[high][low]` by those global city ids, in thousands.

Each table carries a digest test pinning the transcription — `PAYOUT_TABLE_DIGEST` in
[`engine/payouts.test.ts`](engine/payouts.test.ts), `CODES_DIGEST` in
[`engine/rollTable.test.ts`](engine/rollTable.test.ts) — an FNV-1a hash over every cell.
Range and coverage checks can pass on a transposed or mis-copied value; the digest can't.
If you deliberately change a cell (a real correction, not a transcription fix), recompute
and update the digest constant in the same commit, and say why in the commit message.

Defects carried across from the source rather than reproduced-and-fixed:

- **The two mislabelled city groups are fixed.** Counting `engine/cities.ts`'s `GROUPS`
  array in file order, 1-indexed, the 2013 source labelled the 5th and 6th groups —
  **the group containing Denver, Kansas City, Minneapolis and St. Paul** (actually Plains)
  and **the group containing Billings, Seattle and Spokane** (actually Northwest) — both
  `"South Central"`. The 4th group (Birmingham, Dallas, Houston) genuinely is South
  Central and was labelled correctly; three groups carry the literal string, only two are
  wrong. The port's `engine/cities.ts` uses the correct region for each, so this is not a
  live bug — noted here only because it explains why the 2013 file and the port disagree.
  This exact off-by-one (miscounting which two groups are the wrong ones) has recurred in
  project docs before — if you're editing this again, name the groups by contents as
  above, not only by ordinal.
- **The payout matrix was checked against the source, not against the physical board.**
  The digest tests prove the transcription is faithful to `js/railbaronv2.js`; they cannot
  prove the source itself was ever right. See task-3-report.md for how the comparison was
  done.
- `chooseRegion` (the source's second, unreachable destination-computation path) was
  dropped rather than ported — there is only one path now.

### The `$0` constraint

Minneapolis↔St. Paul and San Francisco↔Oakland are the board's only two zero-paying
journeys — legal destinations, worth nothing to land on. `payoutBetween` returns `0` for
them, a real, displayable amount. This is unrelated to `payout: null`, which means "no
payout applies" (the roll landed on the baron's own home town) and renders as `Home`
instead of a dollar figure — see the `paid` derivation in
[`src/board/screens/play.ts`](src/board/screens/play.ts). Anywhere on this path,
`if (payout)` or `payout || fallback` is a bug: both are falsy-on-zero and would treat a
real $0 payout as if it were the null case. Three tests guard the distinction —
`engine/payouts.test.ts` for the matrix, `src/board/screens/play.test.ts` for the two
render cases ("says HOME rather than a payout for a home town", "shows a zero-paying
journey as a real zero, not as blank"), and `src/state/events.ts`'s validator, which
accepts `payout: 0` and would silently discard every saved $0 journey if written as a
truthiness check.

## The map graph

Phase 0 converts the printed map into a graph. Three node kinds, and the distinction is
the cost model:

| On the board | In the data | Costs a move |
|---|---|---|
| White square, black stroke | `city` | yes |
| Plain black dot, no stroke | `dot` | yes |
| Nothing — the line simply forks | `junction` | **no** |

So path cost is the count of `dot` nodes traversed; junctions fall out for free with no
special case. Edges are undirected adjacency between *neighbouring* nodes, carrying the
list of railroads running over them — shared trackage is one edge with several railroads,
not parallel edges.

**Junctions do two jobs, and only one of them is forking.** Three or more edges means a
fork. Exactly two means a *bend point*, placed to shape the drawn route — a coastal line
needs them to follow the shore instead of cutting across water. Both are free, so neither
affects movement; a two-edge junction is correct data, not an unfinished fork.

**Node ids are positional and load-bearing.** `d12` means index 12 in the editor's dots
array *including rejected entries*, so ids stay stable when a point is rejected. Never
renumber; a rejected endpoint orphans its edges rather than silently repointing them.

Coordinates in `data/` are **scan pixel space, 1280×642**. The pipeline:
[`data/rail-baron-graph.json`](data/rail-baron-graph.json) is the hand-traced source of
truth; [`scripts/build-network.mjs`](scripts/build-network.mjs) (`npm run network:build`)
fits a scan→geography warp — a thin-plate spline through the 67 city correspondences,
via Albers — and writes [`engine/network.json`](engine/network.json), which is what the
app imports (via `engine/network.ts`). So the shipped data is real geography while the
printed map's actual route shapes survive — one rendered bulb per real dot, at its real
place. After editing the traced graph, run `npm run graph:validate` (dead ends, orphans,
railroads secretly in two pieces) and rebuild the network; the build fails loudly rather
than emitting suspect data.

### The editor is not in this repo

The one-off tool that produced the graph lives in the **Rail Baron Game Board Design**
project on claude.ai/design, alongside the board concepts it was designed from. It runs
against a scan of the map and holds its working state in browser `localStorage` plus
`graph-base.json` in that project. Don't go looking for it here, and don't rebuild it —
ask before changing it.

The design project also holds the visual direction the port is built to: a departures-board
split-flap treatment for the main screen, and a lightbulb-map treatment for the map view.

## Online mode

Built, tested, and **not yet deployed or played by hand** — see
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-14-online-by-hand-notes.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-14-online-by-hand-notes.md)
for what building it found and what is still owed.

**The log is the wire.** The acting client rolls locally behind the existing
roll→announce→commit gates and sends the resulting `GameEvent`; the server validates it,
appends, persists and broadcasts *the whole log*; every client's state is `replay(log)`,
exactly as pass-and-play is `replay(localStorage)`. There is no incremental sync and no
optimistic apply — a client that missed a broadcast is repaired by the next one.

| Directory | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `session/` | The game half of the wire — versions, message shapes, rejection codes. Node-safe. |
| `server/` | The authoritative server: store, rooms, the two game handlers, boot. |
| `src/net/` | The client half — transport, `useRoom`, `useOnlineGame`. |
| `src/board/screens/online.ts` | Boards 1d/1f and the terminals. |
| `src/GameShell.ts` | The board-driving glue both modes share. |
| `src/OnlineApp.tsx` | The online routes. |

Three things carry the design, and breaking any of them breaks it quietly:

- **`src/state/legal.ts` is the whole authority**, and it is pure over
  `(log, event, sender)`. It is built from the same helpers `useGame`'s own guards read, so
  the client's "may I?" and the server's "you may not" cannot drift into disagreeing. Both
  directions are tested: `gameSocket.test.ts` proves it refuses illegal appends,
  `goldenSocket.test.ts` proves it accepts every legal game. A table that refused
  everything would pass the first suite alone.
- **The lobby's seat ids ARE the game's colours.** `SEAT_SPACE.ids` is `SEATS`, so a lobby
  `playerId` of `'red'` is the `SeatId` `'red'` and no mapping layer exists anywhere. Note
  the server seats in `SEATS` order, so a two-player room is **red and green**, not
  red and blue.
- **The server seeds `joined` and `started` itself at Begin.** Clients can never append
  them, and `appendLegality` refuses all three of `joined`/`renamed`/`started`.

Two owner rulings are encoded rather than derivable: any *seated* player may report the
roll for first player (`orderRolled` is the one event exempt from seat-matching), and undo
belongs to the seat whose action would be popped.

`vendor/lobby` is a git submodule and the server imports it at runtime — `npm run
build:server` exists only to fail loudly when it is empty, because `tsx` compiles nothing
ahead of time and the process would otherwise die at boot after a green build.

## What Phase 1 owes Phase 3

Online multiplayer will consume the lobby extracted from the sibling repo
[`acquire-startups-m1`](../acquire-startups-m1), whose extraction design names this repo
as its intended second consumer. That lobby plugs into a particular shape, so the port
adopts it from the start rather than refactoring into it:

- A pure **`engine/`** at the top level, no React
- Game components under **`src/board/`** — the extraction design says `src/game/`, and the
  board-as-lobby refactor moved them. The requirement is that components live under one
  directory separate from `engine/` and `src/state/`, not that it carries a particular
  name; rename at the lift if the shared lobby turns out to care.
- **State derived by replaying an event log**, not mutated in place
- **Namespaced `localStorage` keys** — both games share the GitHub Pages origin

That repo's `CLAUDE.md` carries the house conventions this one inherits. Two that bind
hardest: derive every displayed value from replayed state rather than hardcoding it, and
prove a new test can fail by breaking the code and reading real output — never by reading
the assertion.

## Testing notes

**`src/test/setup.ts` bridges jsdom's real `localStorage` onto `globalThis` — do not
delete it, even though it looks like dead weight.** Node 26 ships its own experimental
`globalThis.localStorage`, which returns `undefined` unless the process is started with
`--localstorage-file`. Vitest's `populateGlobal` only copies a jsdom `window` property
onto `global` when that key is *absent* from `global` — and `localStorage` is not absent,
because Node already defined it (however uselessly). So jsdom's genuine `Storage`
implementation never gets bridged through, and Node's stub silently wins. jsdom itself is
fine; this is a Node-version interaction, not a jsdom bug. Every test under `src/` that
touches storage (`src/state/storage.test.ts`, plus anything rendering through
`useGame`/`App`) depends on this bridge running before it; without it they fail in a way
that looks unrelated to storage at all.

## Working notes

- **Every push to `main` deploys to GitHub Pages**, gated by the suite and the
  typecheck — a companion that is wrong about a payout is worse than one that is down.
- **The branch is `main`.** Renamed from `master` 2026-08-11; `origin/master` is deleted.
  `bugfixes`, `flippy` and `jsfixes` are 2013–2014 leftovers, deliberately kept.
- **The 2013 jQuery app is gone from the working tree.** `index2.html`, `js/`, `css/`, and
  the rest were deleted once the React port had a passing test suite covering the same
  ground; `git log --all --full-history -- <path>` reaches any of it. Two Rail Barons in
  one repo is how the wrong one gets edited, so there is deliberately only one now.
