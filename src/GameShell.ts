/**
 * The board-driving glue: the announcement holds, the screens record, and the
 * row actions that play the game. It lives here because online needs exactly
 * this behaviour over a different hook, and two copies of it are two places
 * for the roll→announce→commit gates to drift apart.
 *
 * It is a hook rather than a component, deliberately. `App` mounts exactly one
 * `Board` above the routing — a Board per route means navigation unmounts one
 * and mounts another, `useFlap` sees a first render and declines to animate,
 * and the flap that is the entire point of the design never plays on the
 * transition it exists for. A `<GameShell>` rendering its own Board would
 * reintroduce that at the `/pass-and-play` → `/pass-and-play/game` boundary.
 * So this hands `App` what its single Board needs, and `App` renders it. Task
 * 10's online screens plug in the same way.
