/**
 * Home cities, then the roll for who goes first.
 *
 * The rulebook has an order to setup and strict turns make it matter: every
 * baron takes a home city, in seat order and no two the same, and only then do
 * the players roll to see who starts.
 *
 * Only the home rolls go through the board's announce gate. The roll for first
 * player rolls and appends in one tap (`rollOrder` in `useGame`), because
 * there is nothing for the board to announce: it names no region and no city,
 * and its whole result — whose turn it is — is on the next screen the moment
 * the event exists. The gate protects a roll whose outcome the board would
 * otherwise spoil while the panel was still turning; this one has no such
 * outcome to hold back.
