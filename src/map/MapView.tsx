              route over an animation of the previous one. And nothing is

              until the die is thrown, so any step taken there is a step the
              player cannot commit. That is not hypothetical — a pawn standing
              on one half of a twin pair can cross to the other for nothing,
              which the engine rightly offers at zero movement, and tapping it
              drew a route line with no COMMIT and no UNDO to answer it. */}
