/**
 * A window onto the map, and the arithmetic that moves it.
 *
 * The map is projected once into a fixed coordinate space (see `layout`), and
 * that space is *not* the size of the cabinet on screen — the cabinet is
 * whatever the browser window leaves for it. What reconciles the two is the
 * SVG viewBox: a rectangle in map coordinates, drawn into whatever pixels the
 * cabinet has. Zoom and pan are therefore nothing but choosing that rectangle,
 * which is why all of it lives here as arithmetic with no React and no DOM.
 *
 * The state is a centre and a zoom factor rather than the rectangle itself.
 * The rectangle depends on the cabinet's proportions, which change under the
 * user's hand as they resize the window; a centre does not. Storing the
 * rectangle would mean recomputing it on every resize and deciding what to
 * preserve while doing so — with a centre there is nothing to decide.
