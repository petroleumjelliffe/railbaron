  // consumes two rolls for a single tap. The updater itself does nothing
  // but append the one event it was handed, so calling it twice is
  // harmless — both invocations compute the same result from the same
  // input and React keeps only the last.
  //
  // Naming used to be the other half of this hazard, via window.prompt.
  // The board's inline input replaced it, so only the roll remains — but
  // the roll is enough to keep the rule.
  //
  // Reading `state` from the render closure (rather than re-deriving it from
  // the updater's own `log` argument) means two taps landing in the same
  // tick could both read the same pre-tap state. For a single-user tablet
  // app where taps are sequential and each one waits for its own render,
  // that's not a real risk in practice — but it is a real trade-off, not an
  // oversight.
